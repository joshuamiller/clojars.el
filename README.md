* Clojars.el

This Emacs extension allows you to search for projects on clojars.org
and copies your selection to the kill ring in a format suitable for
your `project.clj`.

It is a work in progress; until it's ready for distribution, you can
use it in the meantime by just adding `(load "/path/to/clojars.el")`
to your `init.el`.
